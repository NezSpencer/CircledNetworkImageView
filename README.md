CircledNetworkImageView
=======================

Implementation of Google Volley NetwrokImageView with CircledImageView.  I only solved some bugs and it will work correctly.

With this class you can load external images or bitmap and show them like circled images easy way and asynchronously.

How To Use:
Checks volley doc for how to use volley then get this class and it self will do the magic :)
